        <p class = "biography__content">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even further, pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.  
        </p>
        <p class = "biography__content">From there, the band has soared, gaining 
            international recognition and ranking in the 
            top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
            immediately fell in love with the band’s original 
            and organic attitude, solidifying their place as 
            one of the hottest and fastest up and coming 
            acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to 
            themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to 
            their candid and authentic performances on 
            stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, 
            The Bees Knees are currently recording their 
            second studio album, looking to be released in 
            late 2021.
